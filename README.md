I developed this Google Script for an old colleague who was working as Marketing Assistant. According to my colleague, the Marketing company was asking him to complete a very repetitive task, on a weekly basis, and I offered myself to make his life easier. 

My colleague was being provided with a Spreadsheet. The Spreadsheet had two columns full of URLs. Each URL located in the 1st column had to be matched with an URL located in the 2nd column so that, at the end of the task, the similar URLs were on the same row and by "similar URLs", I mean those that were ending the same way. In order for the Google Script to work as expected, I recommend creating a new Google Spreadsheet.

Then, the two columns have to be distributed the following way:

1. One of the columns with URLs has to be placed on the 1st column of the new Google Spreadsheet.
2. The other column with URLs has to be placed on the 3rd column of the new Google Spreadsheet.

The 2nd and 4th columns of the new Spreadsheet will be left empty so that they can be used by the Google Script.
